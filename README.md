# Travelling Merchant Checker
Checks the Runescape wiki for items sold in the Travelling Merchant's Shop, and notifies you if that item is being sold today

Still a bit rough around the edges

# Usage (Subject to change)
* Download this repository
* Open `items.txt` in a text editor
* Add the name of the item you want to check on a new line

# Future
* Figure out a nice way of setting this up as a recurring, daily job in Windows
